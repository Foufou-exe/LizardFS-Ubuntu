# About 

### Why did you make this script?

I made these scripts in order to facilitate the installation of LizardFS and also to contribute to the LizardFS community, as it's always easy to have something ready to go but also functional. But above all it avoids spending hours to install and configure according to the errors, we can spend a lot of time there ( It is the experiment which speaks XD )  
### Who does this concern as a person?

In other words, all the people who have an operating system under Linux, more precisely under Debian. Of course, you must have a use for LizardFS. 

### Version

Works on all versions of Ubuntu âœ…
- Ubuntu 

# Installation

Get the repository :

```BASH
git clone https://github.com/Foufou-exe/LizardFS-Ubuntu.git
````

Go to the directory you just downloaded :

```BASH
cd LizardFS-Ubuntu
````

Then set the execution permissions so that the scripts can work properly :

```BASH
sudo chmod a+x Ubuntu/*
````

Now go to Next directory :

```BASH
cd Ubuntu
````

Finally you can run the script :

```BASH
./install.sh
````
And that's the end of it, normally everything is functional, you just need to configure and install what you want with the install.sh script ðŸ˜Ž
